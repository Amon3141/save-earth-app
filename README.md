# SaveEarthApp

An interactive iOS app that combines environmental education with augmented reality (AR) to promote sustainable living habits. It was previously on the App Store but is not available now because I don't want to pay for the Apple Developer Program.

## App Sections

The app features three main sections:

### Act
Track your environmental score (starting at 40) and watch the Earth transform based on your daily choices:
- **Good Actions**: Using public transport, reusable bags, paper straws, shorter showers, LED lights, composting, etc.
- **Bad Actions**: Unnecessary car use, plastic bags, long showers, excessive energy use, etc.

Your score affects the Earth's visual state - from healthy (green) to damaged (explosion).

### LeARn
Interactive AR space where you can place and explore 3D models of everyday objects in your real environment. Learn about their environmental impact through augmented reality experiences. Includes models like books, computers, plastic bottles, and more.

### Library
Educational resources and information about environmental conservation, sustainability practices, and tips for reducing your carbon footprint.

## Technical Details
