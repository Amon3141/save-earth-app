# SaveEarthApp

An interactive iOS app that combines environmental education with augmented reality (AR) to promote sustainable living habits. It was previously on the App Store but is not available now as I'm not paying for the developer program anymore.

## Features

- **Environmental Score Tracking**: Track your daily eco-friendly actions with a scoring system
- **Interactive Earth Visualization**: Watch the Earth transform based on your environmental impact score
- **AR Learning Experience**: Explore 3D models of everyday objects in augmented reality
- **Educational Library**: Access resources about environmental conservation
- **Action-Based Learning**: Choose from good and bad environmental actions to see their impact

## How It Works

The app tracks your environmental score (starting at 40) based on your daily choices:
- **Good Actions**: Using public transport, reusable bags, paper straws, shorter showers, etc.
- **Bad Actions**: Unnecessary car use, plastic bags, long showers, excessive energy use, etc.

Your score affects the Earth's visual state - from healthy (green) to damaged (explosion animation).

## Technical Details

- Built with SwiftUI and ARKit
- iOS 14.0+ compatible
- Uses RealityKit for AR experiences
- Includes 3D models for AR visualization (books, computers, plastic bottles, etc.)
